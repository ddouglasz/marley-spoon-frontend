## Recipes App

- A simple app that consumes a contentful Api to display a list of recipes and recipe details. This application is built using React (Nextjs Framework).

## Getting Started

**_1. Environmental variables:_**

- Start by checking the `.env.example` for the keys to each of the .env settings needed.

- Create a `.env.local` and add the expected keys and provide their respective values to start up the app

**_2. Install all dependencies:_** To install all dependencies, run `Yarn`

**_3. Start App:_** run `yarn dev` to start the development server and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

**_4. Tests:_** to run tests, use `yarn test`.

### THINGS TO IMPROVE/TODO

- Write more tests.

- Improve on adding types to my methods and jsx. Leaving types on `any` or `//@ts-ignore` is not good practice.

- Work more on responsiveness.

- Add CI/CD functionality.
