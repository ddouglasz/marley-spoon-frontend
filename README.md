**_Tests:_** run `yarn test` to run tests

### THINGS TO IMPROVE/TODO

- Write more tests.

- Add a loading component.

- Improve on adding types to my methods and jsx. Leaving types on `any` is not good practice.

- Work more on responsiveness.

- Improve the UI features and invest more time in the css styling.

- Better error handling - showing the user a clearer and more descriptive error message.

- Add CI/CD functionality.
